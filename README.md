The objective of this project is to explore a variety of computer I/O systems within cybernetic wearables stylized into a niche but recognizeable fictional form.

Each I/O system is intended to feel natural in how the human operator ingests information and returns input into the computer.

The computer to be used in this project will be a Raspberry Pi 5 (Produced by Adafruit Industries).
